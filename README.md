### What is Tapknack and "What's It All About"?

Not quite a hokey-pokey, but there's definitely some magic to be found! (If you get this joke, we can be friends)

TapKnack is a semi-professional networking platform "built for students, by students" which aims to bring passionate and like-minded students from all areas to work on real products and projects together which, aside from the obvious social benefit, can help them to gain the much-needed experience to land a job right out of uni. No longer will students need to fret about having no experience in their chosen field and struggling to find work.

"You need experience to get experience" - Forget it! Not while Tapknack is around!

A marketing student can work with a business person to develop a product strategy and go-to-market, and a software engineer and UX designer can build the tech and design the experiences that truly matter! An up-and-coming lawyer/legal student can work with a team to help them develop a bullet-proof shareholders agreement.

Tapknack takes the guesswork out of the journey to becoming a working professional, and even where work still can't be found, the projects and products developed can be taken that step further for students to create their very own company where they get to call the shots and make the rules
